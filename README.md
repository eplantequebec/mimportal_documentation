These 2 powershell scripts build HTML pages that describe the SETs and MPRs in the Portal.  I made those PS during a MIM contract for a client.  I wanted something to document the MPR and SET, but I used also that a pedagogic tool.  

They probably have several bugs. Do not hesitate to correct and share the code.
