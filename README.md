# Project Title
MIMPORTAL Auto Documentation

## Getting Started
These 2 powershell scripts build HTML pages that describe the SETs and MPRs in the Portal.  I made those PS during a MIM contract for a client.  I wanted something to document the MPR and SET, but I used also that a pedagogic tool.  

They probably have several bugs. Do not hesitate to correct and share the code.  

### Prerequisites
- Windows
- FIMAutomation Powershell Module.

### Installing

Just put all files in a folder and execute in ISE or in commandline the powershell script you want (For SETs or for MPRs).
