# Project Title
MIMPORTAL Auto Documentation

## Getting Started
Those 2 powershell scripts build HTML pages that describe the SETs and MPRs in the Portal.  I made those PS during a MIM contract for a client.  I wanted something to document the MPR and SET, but I used also that as a pedagogic tool.  

They probably have several bugs. And also, English is not my native language.  Don't hesitate to correct and share the code!  

### Prerequisites
- Windows
- FIMAutomation Powershell Module.

### Installing

Just put all files in a folder and execute in ISE or in commandline the powershell script you want (For SETs or for MPRs).

<b>Describe MPR.ps1</b> describe all MPR with triggers and actiosn.
<b>Describe SETs.ps1</b> describe all SET and CBG groups.
